# Lexicon

Lexicon is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) bot based on [NLP.js](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js) that hangs in [ESOUI room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/lexicon).

## Repository

Here's a brief summary of the most important locations in the repository.

- `src/index.js` is the actual bot implementation.
- `src/features` is where we implement what the bot can do.
- `storage` is used to store runtime data generated by the bot.
- `support` is used during development to launch Matrix and Element instances.

## Development

You'll need Node.js v18+ and to install the dependencies.

```sh
npm ci
```

Then you can run the bot, providing `homeserver`, `username` and `password` via arguments.

```sh
npm start -- -s http://matrix.local.crz.li:8008 -u bot -p thisisnotsecure
```

> ℹ️ We use an external loopback hostname `matrix.local.crz.li` so both your machine and the container can resolve it.

We also provide support files to launch Matrix and Element instances so you can test drive your bot. You'll need Docker v20+ and Docker Compose plugin installed. Also, make sure ports `8000` and `8008` are available.

```sh
docker compose -f support/compose.yml up
```

Head over to <http://localhost:8000>, sign-up and use the credentials with the bot.

## Production

You'll need Docker v20+ and Docker Compose plugin installed. Copy `example.env` to `.env` and edit it appropriately. Then launch the bot service in background.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```
