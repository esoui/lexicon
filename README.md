# Lexicon

Lexicon is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) bot based on [NLP.js](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js) that hangs in [ESOUI room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/lexicon).

## Repository

Here's a brief summary of the most important directories in the repository.

- `nlp` holds NLP corpus and trained model. This is where we configure what the bot can say.
- `src` is where the bot's source code lives.
- `storage` is used to store runtime data generated by bot.
- `support` is used during development to launch Matrix and Element instances.

## Development

You'll need Node.js v18+ and to install the dependencies.

```sh
npm ci
```

Then you can run the bot.

```sh
npm start -- -s http://matrix.local.crz.li:8008 -u bot -p thisisnotsecure
```

If you need we also provide support files to launch Matrix and Element instances so you test drive your bot. You'll need Docker v20+ and Docker Compose plugin installed. Also, make sure ports `8000` and `8008` are available.

```sh
docker compose -f support/compose.yml up
```

Head over to http://localhost:8000, sign-up and use the credentials with the bot.

## Production

You'll need Docker v20+ and Docker Compose plugin installed. Copy `example.env` to `.env` is adjust the values. Then launch the bot service in background.

```sh
docker compose up -d
```
